                        <span>
                            Responsible Travel, simply put, is travel that creates better places for people to live in,
                            and better places to visit. Responsible tourism is fast becoming a global trend. Recognizing
                            the global significance and importance of the responsible tourism has inspired Vietnam's
                            Responsible Travel Club.
                            Created by the World Travel Mart (WTM), World Responsible Tourism Day, is celebrated
                            annually during November. World Responsible Tourism Day is endorsed by the World Tourism
                            Organisation and World <a class="d-inline-block" href="">Travel and Tourism Council.</a>
